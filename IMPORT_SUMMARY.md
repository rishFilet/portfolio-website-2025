## Notes

### Images

The Strapi backup contains image references, but the actual image files are stored in Supabase Storage or external URLs. You may need to:

1. Check your Strapi uploads folder for the actual image files
2. Upload them to Supabase Storage buckets
3. Update the `blog_post_images` and `project_post_images` tables manually

### Missing Data

- No project posts were in the backup
- No technologies were in the backup
- Blog post to tag associations were not migrated (Strapi uses a different junction table structure)

---

## Verification

To verify the import, you can run:

```bash
# View all blog posts
psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54332/postgres -c "SELECT title, is_published FROM blog_posts;"

# View all tags
psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54332/postgres -c "SELECT name FROM tags;"

# View social links
psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54332/postgres -c "SELECT display_name, link FROM social_links;"

# View landing page
psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54332/postgres -c "SELECT header, description FROM landing_page_content;"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the website** - Start your frontend and verify the imported content displays correctly
2. **Add images** - Upload blog post images to Supabase Storage and link them
3. **Tag associations** - Manually associate tags with blog posts in the admin panel
4. **Publish drafts** - Review the draft blog post and publish it if ready
5. **Add projects** - Create new project posts as the backup didn't contain any
