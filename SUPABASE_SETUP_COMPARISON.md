## When to Choose Self-Hosted (Docker)

### ✅ Choose Self-Hosted If:

1. **You have a dedicated server** already running

   - You're already paying for a VPS or dedicated server
   - You want to utilize existing infrastructure

2. **Data sovereignty is important**

   - You need data to stay in specific geographic location
   - Industry regulations require on-premise hosting
   - You want complete control over your data

3. **You prefer open source and no vendor lock-in**

   - Want to avoid dependency on external services
   - Prefer self-reliance and control

4. **You have DevOps experience**

   - Comfortable with Docker and server management
   - Can handle database backups and security

5. **Budget constraints**
   - Already have server infrastructure
   - Want to avoid monthly SaaS costs

### ⚠️ Be Aware:

- You're responsible for security updates
- You need to set up backups
- You manage database performance
- You need to configure SSL/HTTPS manually
- You troubleshoot infrastructure issues

## When to Choose Cloud

### ✅ Choose Cloud If:

1. **You want quick setup**

   - Get started in minutes
   - No infrastructure management

2. **You prefer managed services**

   - Automatic updates and security patches
   - Built-in monitoring and logging
   - Automated backups

3. **You need global performance**

   - Built-in CDN
   - Multiple regions available
   - Optimized infrastructure

4. **You're new to DevOps**

   - No need to manage servers
   - Less technical complexity
   - Focus on building, not maintaining

5. **You want enterprise features**
   - Advanced monitoring
   - Point-in-time recovery
   - Professional support available

### ⚠️ Be Aware:

- Ongoing monthly costs (after free tier)
- Data stored with third party
- Limited customization options
- Dependent on Supabase service availability

## Setup Commands Comparison

### Self-Hosted Setup:

```bash
# One-line installation
./scripts/install-supabase-docker.sh

# Management
~/supabase-[instance-name]/manage-supabase.sh start|stop|restart|logs|status
```

### Cloud Setup:

```bash
# Create account at supabase.com (manual)
# Get API keys from dashboard (manual)

# Run migrations
cd backend-supabase
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_REF
supabase db push
```

## Cost Comparison

### Self-Hosted Costs:

- **Server**: $5-20/month (VPS) or $0 (if you already have one)
- **Bandwidth**: Usually included with VPS
- **Storage**: Depends on VPS plan
- **Total**: $0-20/month (mostly pre-existing costs)

### Cloud Costs:

- **Free Tier**:
  - 500MB database
  - 1GB file storage
  - 2GB bandwidth
  - 50,000 monthly active users
- **Pro Plan**: $25/month
  - 8GB database
  - 100GB file storage
  - 50GB bandwidth
  - No user limits

## Performance Comparison

### Self-Hosted:

- **Latency**: Depends on server location (can be optimized for your users)
- **Throughput**: Limited by your server specs
- **Scaling**: Manual (upgrade server or add load balancer)
- **Best for**: Regional applications, controlled user base

### Cloud:

- **Latency**: Global CDN, optimized routing
- **Throughput**: High, managed automatically
- **Scaling**: Automatic based on usage
- **Best for**: Global applications, variable traffic

## Migration Path

### Self-Hosted → Cloud:

```bash
# Export database
pg_dump -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres > backup.sql

# Import to cloud (in Supabase dashboard SQL editor)
# Paste backup.sql content
```

### Cloud → Self-Hosted:

```bash
# Export from cloud dashboard
# Project Settings → Database → Connection pooling
# Get connection string

# Import to self-hosted
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres < backup.sql
```

## Quick Decision Flow

```
Do you have DevOps experience?
├─ No → Choose Cloud ☁️
└─ Yes → Do you already have a server?
    ├─ No → Choose Cloud ☁️
    └─ Yes → Do you need data sovereignty?
        ├─ Yes → Choose Self-Hosted 🐳
        └─ No → Do you want to save $25/mo?
            ├─ Yes → Choose Self-Hosted 🐳
            └─ No → Choose Cloud ☁️ (easier)
```

## Getting Started

### For Self-Hosted:

1. Read: `ADMIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md` → Option A
2. Run: `./scripts/install-supabase-docker.sh`
3. Save the credentials file securely
4. Follow the guide to configure frontend

### For Cloud:

1. Read: `ADMIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md` → Option B
2. Create account at [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
3. Get API keys from dashboard
4. Follow the guide to configure frontend

## Still Unsure?

**Start with Cloud free tier** - It's:

- ✅ Faster to set up
- ✅ Easier to manage
- ✅ Free to start
- ✅ Easy to migrate later if needed

You can always migrate to self-hosted later if you need more control or want to reduce costs.

## Support

- **Self-Hosted**: Community support, Docker/PostgreSQL forums
- **Cloud**: Supabase community, GitHub discussions, email support (Pro+)
- **This Project**: See `ADMIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for troubleshooting
